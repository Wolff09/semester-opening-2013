semester-opening2013-website
============================

Website for the fabulous Semester Opening Party at TU KL
by [FSInfo](http://www.fachschaft.informatik.uni-kl.de).

### Idea

The internal motto for the party is 'space'.
To turn this motto into a web page we want to implement a
parallax scrolling web page with some layers of planets, stars,
and maybe an aurora (or just some smaller stars) in the background.

[This page](http://f6design.com/projects/parallax-scrolling/)
is a very nice demo where you can see parallax scrolling in action.

### Resources

This page will use the following libraries/frameworks:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
